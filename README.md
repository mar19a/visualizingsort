# Sorting Algorithm Visualize

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This project is designed to help you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms in a simple and interactive way.

Here are the sorting algorithms that are included in this visualizer:

Bubble Sort
Comb Sort
Cycle Sort
Heap Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Monkey Sort
Quick Sort
Radix Sort
Selection Sort
Shell Sort

How to use the visualizer:

The visualizer is easy to use. Simply select the sorting algorithm you want to see from the drop-down menu and specify the size of the array you want to sort. Then click on "Sort" to see the visualization of the sorting process.

You can also adjust the speed of the visualization using the "Speed" slider. This will allow you to see each step of the sorting process in slow motion or fast-forward.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Comb Sort:

Comb Sort is an improvement over the Bubble Sort algorithm. It works by comparing elements that are a certain distance apart (known as the "gap") instead of comparing adjacent elements. This helps to eliminate larger elements from the list more quickly.

Cycle Sort

Cycle Sort is an in-place and unstable sorting algorithm. It is based on the idea of cycling through the list and finding the right place for each element by counting the number of elements that are less than it.

Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It is efficient for large data sets and is considered one of the fastest sorting algorithms for medium-sized data sets.

Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large data sets than more advanced algorithms such as Quicksort, Heapsort, or Merge sort.

Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into two smaller arrays and then recombining them in sorted order. This is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, with a time complexity of O(n log n).

Monkey Sort

Monkey Sort, also known as Bogo Sort, is a randomized sorting algorithm that works by randomly shuffling the elements in the array until they are in the correct order. It is not a practical sorting algorithm, but it is included in this visualizer for demonstration purposes.

Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a "pivot" element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. Quick Sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms for large data sets.

Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort an array of numbers.

Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. The algorithm continues this process until the entire array is sorted.

Shell Sort

Shell Sort is a variant of Insertion Sort that is more efficient for larger data sets. It works by comparing elements that are a certain distance apart, known as the "gap", instead of comparing adjacent elements. As the gap decreases, the list is partially sorted, and eventually, the gap is reduced to 1, resulting in a fully sorted list.
